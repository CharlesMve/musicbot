# Twitter musicbot
Bot on Twitter that fetches currently playing song from Deezer

Initializes by simply running the code in a compiler

Gets the currently playing song from the Deezer API and posts it on @DeezerReader on Twitter/X

**CURRENTLY NOT WORKING**

Need to update the code due to API changes that came about with the move from Twitter to X
